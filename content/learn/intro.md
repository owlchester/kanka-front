## What is Kanka?

Kanka is a collaborative worldbuilding and tabletop RPG campaign management tool. Whether you're a game master building a rich world or a player keeping track of your adventures, Kanka gives you the tools to organise everything in one place.

## Creating your first campaign

After signing up, you can create a campaign in seconds. Give it a name, a description, and optionally set its visibility (private or public).

Inside a campaign you can manage:

- **Characters** – NPCs, player characters, and anyone else in your world
- **Locations** – From continents down to individual rooms
- **Organisations** – Guilds, governments, religions, and factions
- **Timelines** – Track in-world events and history
- **Journals** – Session notes and in-world writing

## Next steps

Once you have your campaign set up, explore the sidebar to start adding entities. Each entity type has its own fields and can be linked to others, building a web of interconnected world content.
