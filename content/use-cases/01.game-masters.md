## Picture the scene

It's game night. Your players have just bumped into that shady merchant from a few sessions ago. One of them says, *"Didn't he mention a sister in the capital?"* Another adds, *"Wasn't he tied to that noble house we helped out?"*

You pause. Panic flickers. You're flipping through notebooks, dragging open old files, scrolling endlessly through chat logs. The information is in there somewhere... if only you could find it.

For Game Masters, this scenario is all too familiar. As your campaign grows, so does the chaos. You've probably dealt with this one too many times:

- Characters scattered across half a dozen notebooks
- Locations hidden in long-forgotten Word docs
- Plot threads tracked in spreadsheets (or worse, only in your head)
- Timelines that don't quite line up anymore
- Player knowledge mixed in with GM-only secrets

And in the middle of a session, that mess causes real problems: broken continuity, forgotten details, awkward pauses while you search for that one crucial note.

## Say hello to your new campaign hub

Kanka gives you one place to manage it all. Notes, maps, NPCs, timelines — all connected, searchable, and right where you need them. No more digging. No more guessing. Just smooth, confident storytelling.

## One tool to rule them all

Kanka's not just another wiki or note app. It's a proper campaign management system, built for how GMs actually run games.

Here's what you get, all in one place:

- **Characters:** Deep profiles with custom fields, secrets, and relationship tracking
- **Locations:** Nesting, maps, and points of interest for a connected world
- **Timeline:** Visualise your story's past, present, and future
- **Factions:** Organise groups, alliances, rivalries, religions, and shifting power dynamics
- **Quests:** Track objectives, status, rewards, and key players
- **Notes:** Session plans, player handouts, random lore
- **Journals:** Summaries, logs, and in-character entries

Everything links together, so your world feels alive — and your sessions run smoother.

## Building a world that lives and breathes

### Characters that stick in your players' minds

Forget basic stat blocks. Kanka helps you create characters with depth, history, rizz, and *secrets*.

- Custom traits that match your system
- Secrets only you can see
- Family trees, mentors, enemies — it's all linkable
- Upload portraits
- Track status, location, and inventory at a glance

### Locations that make sense

From vast continents to that one dodgy alley behind the tavern, Kanka helps you keep every place straight.

#### Features that make your world feel real

- Link locations together in logical hierarchies
- Pin places on your own maps
- Track who lives where, and who just passed through
- Tie locations to historical events
- Hide secrets until players uncover them
- Add fields like climate, danger level, or magic presence

### Quests (and not just fetch quests)

No more scribbled notes about "the elf with the job offer". Kanka keeps your quests clean and connected.

#### Quest features that drive your story forward

- Nest side quests under bigger arcs
- Link NPCs, targets, and quest-givers
- Tie quests to relevant places
- Track status and outcomes
- Note down rewards
- Keep your plans private until the moment's right

## Connecting everything together

What truly sets Kanka apart is how every element of your campaign can be connected. This web of relationships transforms your notes from static information into a living, breathing world.

### Relationship mapping that reveals the bigger picture

You can map relationships like:

- Family ties, friendships, or rivalries
- Who's from where
- Which factions characters belong to
- Which events happened where
- Who owns what
- Which quests link to whom

So when your players ask, "Wait, didn't this knight used to serve that duke?", you've got the answer in seconds.

## Real-time tools for game night

Kanka isn't just for prep. It shines at the table too.

- **Quick search:** Find any campaign element in seconds
- **Permission settings:** Reveal information to players as it becomes known in-game
- **Mobile friendly:** Access your campaign from any device
- **Updates:** Keep players informed of new revelations
- **Custom dashboards:** Tailor a dashboard for your session prep or for your players

## Secrets kept safe

One of Kanka's most powerful features is its permission system, allowing you to control exactly what information players can see.

- **Entity Permissions:** Control visibility of entire characters, locations, or other elements
- **Attribute Permissions:** Reveal specific details while keeping others hidden
- **Campaign Secrets:** Keep GM-only notes completely private
- **Player Theories:** Create spaces for players to document their own theories and notes

Because every reveal hits harder when it's been properly hidden.

## Go beyond the basics

Kanka covers more than just characters and quests.

### Calendars & Timelines

Build your own calendar system and see how your world's history fits together.

### Factions & Organizations

Map out political movements, criminal empires, cults, or rival adventuring parties.

### Items & Artifacts

Track ownership, lore, magical properties, and their role in the story.

### Journal & Session Notes

Record what happened, from either your POV or in-character. Connect notes to the rest of the world.
