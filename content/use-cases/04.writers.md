## The writer's dilemma

We've all been there. That side character you introduced in chapter three. What was their motivation again? Was the big reveal meant to come before or after the fire at the manor? And where did you write down that plot twist you thought of six months ago?

Sticky notes, half-finished spreadsheets, and twenty open tabs can only get you so far. It's too easy for your story to become scattered and disjointed.

## Keep everything in one place

**Kanka** gives you a single space where your whole story lives. It's not just for writing scenes or drafting chapters — it's for managing all the characters, locations, timelines, and ideas that make up your world.

### Bring your characters to life

Build out proper profiles for your characters that grow with the story. Track:

- Their motivations and backstories
- How they're connected to others
- Character arcs and development milestones
- Physical descriptions and personality traits

Link characters directly to the events, locations, and arcs they're part of, so that nothing slips through the cracks.

### Craft living worlds

Your settings are more than just backdrops — they're fundamental elements that shape your story. With Kanka, you can:

- Create detailed location hierarchies (continents, countries, cities, buildings)
- Attach historical events as they happen
- Track how places evolve across the story
- Link locations to the characters who inhabit them

### Master your timeline

Timelines don't have to live in your head (or worse, a Word doc you never open). With Kanka you can:

- Visualize your entire story arc from beginning to end
- Create parallel timelines for complex narratives
- Track character journeys alongside major plot events
- Rearrange events and instantly see how they affect your story's flow

When inspiration strikes, just drop the new idea in and see how it lines up.

### Secrets, revelations, and plot twists

Keep your mystery elements in order without giving anything away:

- Add secret notes and posts visible only to you
- Track clues and foreshadowing moments
- Store plot twists safely until it's time to reveal them
- Keep everything consistent, even when you write out of order

### Organize your research

Whether you're researching Victorian slang or designing your own magic system, Kanka helps you stay organised:

- Create dedicated journals for research notes
- Upload reference images and documents
- Tag everything to keep it organised
- Jump to your notes when you're writing the scene they belong to

No more scrolling through screenshots or wondering what folder it's in.

## Built for *your* process

Not every writer works the same way, and Kanka doesn't expect you to. Whether you like to outline everything first or you prefer to discover the story as you go, Kanka gives you the freedom to write your way.

As your manuscript evolves, so does your Kanka world. Characters grow, plots shift, worlds deepen. And it all stays connected.
