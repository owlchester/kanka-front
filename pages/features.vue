        <h3 class="">Free to use</h3>
        <p>
          Tired of having to pay for basic features like unlimited campaigns, having limits on the number of elements in a campaign, or not being able to control who sees what? We are too, which is why all core features of Kanka are absolutely free. We also have some <NuxtLink to="/pricing#paid-features" class="link">bonuses for our subscribers</NuxtLink> that are nice to have, though not essential. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="collaborative" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h3>Collaborative</h3> 
        <p>
          We've built Kanka to support worlds with multiple members and multiple campaigns. Add your friends to the campaign, assign them to one or several roles, and control what features and information they have access to. You can also view the campaign as a member at any time, just to make sure you haven't left content visible that shouldn't be.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="modular" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h3>Modular</h3>
        <p>
          We've focused our efforts on building about 20 different modules in Kanka that each focus on one aspect of playing a TTRPG or wordbuilding in general. In each campaign, you can create characters, locations, families, organisations, items, quests, journals, calendars, events, abilities and more. Don't need abilities? No problem, you can disable modules of your choice in each campaign, simplifying your setup to focus on what's important to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="updates" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h3>Module</h3>
        <p>
          Kanka isn't just a <NuxtLink to="/about" class="link">small team</NuxtLink> of passionate worldbuilders. It's a huge community of dedicated users who help us shape and push frequent updates. We take pride in focusing on features that our community want and love. On average, we release two big updates every month to all users, and some months we spoil our users with more. We regularly go into detail about these upcoming updates and collect feedback on our Discord.</p>
      </div>


      <div id="dashboards" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
        <h3>Campaign dashboards</h3>
        <p>
          The dashboard is the central hub where you control your campaign. Each campaign can fully customise the dashboard, adding widgets from a long list of available options. For large campaigns with multiple groups, premium campaigns can create multiple dashboards tailored to each role.</p>

        <h3>Entities in Kanka</h3>
        <p>
          Kanka is built around a list of around 20 different entities. These are the pre-defined types of core objects in a campaign. They include characters, locations, families, items, quests, journals, calendars, timelines, and more. They all share some functionality but are unique in their own way and interact with other elements of your campaign.</p>

        <div id="inventory" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
          <h3>Inventory</h3>
          <p>
            Every entity can have its own inventory. This feature is used to manage a character's possessions, a shop's (location) sale inventory, a quest's reward for completion, a family's fortune, or any other scenarios you can think of. The inventory feature interacts with the items of your campaign, but is flexible and can be used without creating every item in your campaign.</p>

        <div id="abilities" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
          <h3>Abilities</h3>
          <p>
            As with inventories, every entity can have abilities. Create abilities in your campaign, and attach them to your entities. These can be the powers of a character, the effects of a lair (location), a special ability granted from being part of a family, or a curse caused by eating a hag's cupcake. Abilities have charges to keep track of how often they were used, and can be combined with an entity's attributes.</p>

        <div id="attributes" class="flex flex-col gap-5">
          <h3>Attributes</h3>
          <p>
            Probably the most confusing and complex feature of entities are their attributes. These can be little bits of information like tracking a character's HP, a location's population, a religion (organisation)'s number of shrines, etc. Attributes of an entity can reference each other to calculate values, for example a character's HP, where HP = Level * Constitution.
          </p>
          <p>
            An entity's attributes can also be styled to look like a TTRPG character sheet by using our <a href="//marketplace.kanka.io">marketplace</a>.

          <h3>Journals</h3>
          <p>
            Plan your session or write a session recap in the eyes of a character using our journals module. These can be attached to calendars to keep track of both a real world date and an in-game date where something happened.

            Prepare and keep track of your game's quests, where they will take the players, who's involved, and what organisations are secretly pulling the strings. Once a quest is complete, flag it as such and move on to the next one.
