    <h2 class="text-purple">From private to public: share your homebrew</h2>
    <p>If you've ever tried sharing your TTRPG content, you know the pain, endless PDFs, scattered Google Drive folders, platforms that just weren't built with worldbuilding in mind.</p>

      <p>Kanka changes that. It's made for creators like you, letting you present your world in a clean, organised, actually-usable way. And it works with the platforms you already use to monetise your work.</p>
  </Section>

  <Section align="left">
    <h2 class="text-purple">Your content, your rules</h2>

    <p>You're in control of what you share, and how you share it. Whether it's for everyone, just your supporters, or a sneaky teaser to get folks curious.</p>

    <h3>Upload complete world packages</h3>
    <p>Turn your homebrew settings into proper digital worlds. Share your maps, NPCs, factions, quests, and everything in between, all presented beautifully and ready to explore.</p>

    <h3>Exclusive content for your supporters</h3>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-3">
      <p>While Kanka doesn't currently have a built-in monetization system, it's build to support the tools you already use:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>Make supporter-only campaigns for your Patreon backers</li>
        <li>Share exclusive links with Kickstarter pledgers</li>
        <li>Run private campaigns for your subscribers</li>
        <li>Use public content as a teaser to drive interest in your paid stuff</li>
      </ul>
