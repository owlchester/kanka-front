    <h2 class="text-purple">Picture the scene</h2>
    <p>It's game night. Your players have just bumped into that shady merchant from a few sessions ago. One of them says, <em>"Didn't he mention a sister in the capital?"</em> Another adds, <em>"Wasn't he tied to that noble house we helped out?"</em></p>

    <p>You pause. Panic flickers. You're flipping through notebooks, dragging open old files, scrolling endlessly through chat logs. The information is in there somewhere... if only you could find it.</p>

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-3">
    <p>For Game Masters, this scenario is all too familiar. As your campaign grows, so does the chaos. You've probably dealt with this one too many times:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>Characters scattered across half a dozen notebooks</li>
        <li>Locations hidden in long-forgotten Word docs</li>
        <li>Plot threads tracked in spreadsheets (or worse, only in your head)</li>
        <li>Timelines that don't quite line up anymore</li>
        <li>Player knowledge mixed in with GM-only secrets</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>And in the middle of a session, that mess causes real problems: broken continuity, forgotten details, awkward pauses while you search for that one crucial note.</p>
