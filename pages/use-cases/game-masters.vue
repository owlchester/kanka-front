    <p>Picture this: It's game night. Your players have just encountered the mysterious merchant they met three sessions ago. One player asks, "Didn't he mention having a sister in the capital city?" Another chimes in, "And wasn't he somehow connected to that noble house we helped?"</p>

    <p>You freeze, frantically flipping through notebooks, searching digital files, and scrolling through chat logs. Somewhere, buried in your notes, is the information you need—if only you could find it.</p>

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-3">
    <p>For Game Masters, this scenario is all too familiar. As your campaign grows in complexity and depth, so does the challenge of keeping track of it all:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li class="">Character details scribbled across multiple notebooks</li>
        <li>Location descriptions buried in word documents</li>
        <li>Plot threads tracked in spreadsheets (or worse, only in your memory)</li>
        <li>Campaign timelines that become increasingly difficult to maintain</li>
        <li>Player-accessible information mixed with GM-only secrets</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>In the heat of gameplay, disorganized worldbuilding leads to inconsistencies, forgotten plot points, and unnecessary session delays. The richer your world becomes, the harder it is to manage—until now.</p>

    <h3>Relationship Mapping That Reveals the Bigger Picture</h3>

      <p>In Kanka, you can create explicit connections between:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>Characters and other characters (family, allies, enemies)</li>
