    <h2 class="text-purple">Content Organization</h2>

This allows for natural interconnections between all elements of your world. The relationship system lets you create complex webs of connections while maintaining clarity.</p>

    <p>Kanka was built from the ground up with tabletop RPG campaigns in mind. The quest system, calendar integration, and character management tools are deeply integrated with each other, making it natural to run ongoing campaigns alongside worldbuilding. The focus is on practical tools for game masters and players.</p>
    <p>World Anvil excels at supporting writers with specialized features like manuscript organization, plot development tools, and detailed character arcs. Their campaign tools are more focused on presenting information to players, with strong features for revealing selective content and managing reading permissions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-purple">Customization Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Kanka emphasizes extensibility through its community plugin system. Users can enhance their worlds with community-created plugins that add new features and functionality, while maintaining the platform's core ease of use. The platform also supports custom CSS for those who want to personalize their world's appearance.</p>
    <p>World Anvil also offers extensive visual customization through CSS and templates, though this may require more technical knowledge to fully utilize.</p>
