    All of our subscriptions allow you to unlock premium features for at least one campaign. Doing so unlocks the following benefits for a campaign. A campaign can be downgraded and upgraded at any time. For example if a campaign is over, you can downgrade it and upgrade another campaign instead. Downgrading a campaign doesn't delete any data related to premium features, but simply hides them until the campaign is upgraded again.
